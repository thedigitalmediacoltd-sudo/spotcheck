# Terms of Use

Use SpotCheck responsibly. These terms cover everything from account access to subscription billing.

## 1. Not Legal or Financial Advice

**Important**: SpotCheck is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional legal, financial, or insurance advice.

The information, AI-generated content, negotiation scripts, legal templates, and market comparisons provided by SpotCheck are not legal or financial advice. We are not licensed legal, financial, or insurance advisors.

**Always consult a qualified professional**—a solicitor, financial advisor, or insurance broker—before making legal or financial decisions. Never disregard professional advice based on anything you read or receive from SpotCheck.

You’re responsible for reviewing, customizing, and verifying all AI-generated content before use. We don’t guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or applicability of any AI-generated content or market comparisons.

## 2. Subscriptions and Billing

### Subscription Plans

**Pro**: £24.99 one-time payment for lifetime access to unlimited scans, AI analysis, legal templates, and all Pro features.

**Free**: 1 scan per month and basic reminders.

### Payment and Refunds

All payments are handled through your app store (App Store or Google Play). You agree to their terms.

**Lifetime Subscriptions**: All sales are final. Refund requests are handled according to your app store’s policies.

**Free Tier**: Free to use with the stated limitations. No payment required.

**Restoring Purchases**: Your Pro status is tied to your account. You can restore it on new devices through your app store.

### Feature Availability

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time. While we aim to provide lifetime access, we can’t guarantee indefinite availability of all features.

## 3. Your Content

### What You Create

"Your Content" includes documents you scan, bills you enter, chat logs with our AI coach, and any notes you add.

### How We Use Your Content

By using SpotCheck, you grant us a license to use your content to:
- Provide the service to you
- Analyze your data for personalized AI features
- Generate scripts and templates
- Improve the app

This license ends when you delete your account, except for anonymized, aggregated data used for improvements.

### AI Processing

Your content may be processed by AI services (as described in our Privacy Policy) to provide personalized features. These services don’t use your data to train their models. Your data remains private.

Document images are never sent to third parties—only extracted text is processed.

### Content Standards

You agree not to post content that is:
- Illegal or violates laws
- Obscene, threatening, or abusive
- Protected by copyright without permission
- Contains others’ personal information without consent
- Contains malicious code or viruses

We may remove or edit such content.

## 4. Intellectual Property

### Our Service

SpotCheck and all its contents, features, and functionality are owned by us or our licensors. "SpotCheck" and "SpotCheck: Bill Defender" are our trademarks.

### Your License

We grant you a limited, non-transferable license to use SpotCheck for personal, non-commercial use, subject to these terms.

### AI-Generated Content

You own the specific text and templates the AI generates for you. However, the underlying AI technology is our property.

You may use AI-generated content for personal purposes, but you acknowledge:
- It’s provided "as is" without warranties
- You’re responsible for reviewing and customizing it
- It shouldn’t replace professional advice
- You’re solely responsible for how you use it

### Third-Party Content

The app may link to third-party content or services. We’re not responsible for that content. Your use of third-party services is subject to their terms.

- Gain unauthorized access to the service or other accounts
- Disrupt the service or networks
- Transmit malicious code or viruses
- Reverse engineer or decompile the app
- Use automated systems to access the app
- Impersonate others
- Abuse the free tier by creating multiple accounts

## 6. Account Security

You’re responsible for keeping your account secure. We’re not liable for losses from your failure to secure your account.

You’re responsible for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately of unauthorized use.

## 7. Account Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access for any reason, including if you breach these terms—such as fraudulent activity, prohibited content, or free tier abuse.

Upon termination, your right to use SpotCheck ends immediately. We’ll handle your data according to our Privacy Policy. You can request immediate deletion by contacting support@spotcheck.app.

If your account is terminated for breaching these terms, you forfeit Pro features, including lifetime subscription benefits.

- Bugs, viruses, or other harmful content
- Loss or damage from use of any content

Some jurisdictions don’t allow these limitations, so they may not apply to you.

- Your use of the service

## 12. Changes to Terms

We may update these terms at any time. If we make material changes, we’ll provide at least 30 days’ notice before they take effect.

By continuing to use SpotCheck after changes become effective, you agree to the updated terms. If you don’t agree, stop using the service.
