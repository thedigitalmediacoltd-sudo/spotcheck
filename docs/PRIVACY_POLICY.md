# Privacy Policy

Your data belongs to you. Everything is encrypted, optional, and exportable.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect data to provide and improve SpotCheck. Here’s what that includes:

### Information You Provide

**Your Documents**: Bills, contracts, insurance policies, MOTs, warranties, and subscriptions you scan or enter. This includes:
- Titles and categories
- Expiry and renewal dates
- Costs and renewal prices
- Cancellation terms
- Vehicle registration numbers (for MOT and tax tracking)
- Text extracted from scanned documents (images are processed on your device and deleted immediately)

**Your Preferences**: Subscription status, scan usage, and app settings like biometric authentication preferences and notification settings.

**Reminders**: Renewal reminders and calendar events you create.

### Sensitive Financial Data

We handle your financial information with care. This includes bills, subscription costs, renewal prices, and payment amounts. This data is essential for the app to work and to provide personalized insights.

### AI-Related Data

To power AI features, we process:

**Extracted Text**: Text from your scanned documents is analyzed by our AI service to extract information and generate insights. Images are processed on your device and deleted immediately after text extraction. We never upload or store images.

**AI Chat History**: Conversations with our financial coach are stored to maintain context.

**AI Results**: We store analysis outputs like extracted fields, negotiation scripts, and recommendations.

### Subscription Data

We track whether you’re a Free or Pro user through your app store account. We don’t collect or store payment card details.

For Free users, we track your scan count to enforce the monthly limit (1 scan per month).

### Automatically Collected Data

**Device Information**: We collect device type, operating system, IP address, and similar metadata to keep the app secure and working properly.

**Crash Reports**: When the app encounters issues, we collect crash logs, error messages, and diagnostic information. This doesn’t include your financial data or document content.

**Usage Analytics**: We collect how you interact with the app—which features you use, how long you spend on screens—to understand what’s valuable and improve the experience. This data is anonymized.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your data to:
- Provide core features like tracking bills, setting reminders, and organizing your documents
- Power AI features like document analysis, financial coaching, and generating negotiation scripts and legal templates
- Improve the app by analyzing usage patterns and fixing bugs
- Manage your subscription and restore Pro features

## 3. Data Sharing

We don’t sell your data. We only share it with services essential for the app to work.

**Cloud Storage**: Your data is stored securely with our cloud provider for sync, security, and authentication. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

**AI Services**: Extracted text (never images) is sent to our AI provider for analysis through secure, encrypted connections. This powers document analysis, data extraction, and AI-generated content.

**Error Monitoring**: Crash logs and diagnostic information are sent to our error monitoring service to help us fix bugs. This doesn’t include your financial data or document content.

**Analytics**: Usage data is sent to our analytics service in anonymized, aggregated form to help us understand feature usage and improve the app.

**Subscription Management**: Your app store handles subscription purchases and restoration. We don’t have access to your payment information.

**Government Services**: When using vehicle tax features, vehicle registration numbers may be sent to government services to retrieve tax information. Your financial data isn’t shared.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

### How Long We Keep Data

**Your Documents**: Stored on your device and in the cloud until you delete them or your account.

**AI Chat History**: Stored until you delete your account or manually delete conversations.

**Crash Logs**: Retained for up to 90 days, then automatically deleted.

**Analytics**: Retained for up to 1 year in anonymized form.

### What Gets Deleted

When you delete your account, we permanently remove:

Crash logs and analytics data that were previously collected may remain in anonymized form according to the retention periods above, but they can’t be linked back to your account.
